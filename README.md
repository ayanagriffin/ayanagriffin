  Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
</h1>
<p>
 I'm Ayana, a CS student born and raised in the midwest. I have a particular love for building and designing beautiful, meaningul web projects that focus on social issues.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Currently</b>, I'm working with Trill Project and Develop for Good to use technology to de-stigmatize mental health and make sure students are provided for, especially during the pandemic. I'm also volunteering with coding programs, such as Black Girls Code, where I help mentor and teach students.
</p>
<p>
  <b>In the past</b>, I've attended Computer Science programs at Google and Carnegie Mellon University, created a Chrome browser extension, and studied abroad in Ghana!
</p>
<p>
  <b>Soon</b>, I'll start at Stanford University where I'll be studying Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Outside of coding</b>, I love playing my kalimba, crocheting, and learning about other cultures. I love to meet and chat with new people, so feel free to say hi!
